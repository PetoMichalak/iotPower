 * EPL decomposition,
 * Logical Plan optimisation
 * Physical Plan enumeration
 * Energy model evaluation
 * Device specific compilation (coming)
   * Pebble Watch
   * iPhone
   * Esper node (via d2ESPer)

#### Requirements ####
 * configuration file (usually input/pathFinder.conf)
 * Neo4j server
 
### How do I get set up? ###

* Clone

### Upcoming functionality ###

* support for multi-hop sxfer operator (infrastructure nodes),
* confidence intervals calculation,
* estimated battery lifetime calculation.
