# PATH2iot vision
The _PATH2iot_ - holistic, distributed stream processing framework automatically partitions and distributes processing across the available components (in this case wearable, phone and cloud) depending on the computational capabilities of the platforms, and the non-functional requirements (e.g. battery life).

# Folder structure

* PATH2iot - PATHfinder module (v0.1.0.0) and PATHdeployer (coming);
* data - all energy related data (in a shared Sync folder) used to derive Power Impact coefficients (coming);
* analysis - contains a detailed Technical Report with measurement protocol and also contains R scripts used to process and visualise relevant features from the measured and calculated data (coming);

# Any questions?
